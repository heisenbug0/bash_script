# Python Web Framework Deployments

Python framework deployments are coming soon.

## Planned Support

### Django
Full-featured web framework with admin interface.
- Complete project setup
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Static file serving
- Admin interface ready

### Flask  
Lightweight web framework for APIs.
- Minimal setup
- Database integration
- Perfect for microservices

### FastAPI
Modern API framework with automatic documentation.
- Built-in API docs
- High performance
- Type hints support

## Current Status

Python deployments are in development. For now, you can:

1. **Use our Node.js scripts** for API backends
2. **Deploy static React frontends** that consume APIs
3. **Check back soon** for Python framework support

## Coming Soon

We're working on:
- Django deployment with PostgreSQL
- Flask API deployment
- FastAPI service deployment
- Python virtual environment management
- Gunicorn + Nginx setup
